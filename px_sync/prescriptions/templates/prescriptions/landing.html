<p class="nhsuk-body">This service can be used to synchronise repeat prescriptions if you receive them at different
    times. After you have entered all of the information needed to synchronise your prescriptions, a prescription
    synchronisation request will be generated that you can give to your GP or other dispensing body.</p>

<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">What kinds of prescription can be synchronised?</h2>

<p class="nhsuk-body">Right now, this service is a proof of concept and can be used for tablets, capsules and other
    "solid-form" medications. It isn't recommended that you use this service for inhalers, creams and other "on-demand"
    medications which are more difficult to synchronise.</p>

<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Before you start</h2>

<p class="nhsuk-body">Before you start, you'll need:</p>

<ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
    <li>The names of the drugs on each of your prescriptions (as written on the prescription)</li>
    <li>The quantity of the drugs on each of your prescriptions</li>
    <li>The period which your prescription covers (i.e. the repeat cycle)</li>
</ul>

<a class="nhsuk-button" href="prescriptions/reference">Start now</a>

<h2 class="nhsuk-body">If you've used this service before</h2>

<p class="nhsuk-body">If you started creating a synchronisation request in the past, you should have made a note of your
    reference number. To continue with your synchronisation request, or to view your completed synchronisation request,
    you can enter it below.</p>

<form action="/prescriptions/resume" method="POST">

    <div class="nhsuk-form-group">
        <label class="nhsuk-label" for="reference">What is your reference number?</label>
        <div class="nhsuk-hint" id="reference-hint">Your reference number is made up of 6 characters which may be
            numbers or letters. For example, AA00A1.</div>
